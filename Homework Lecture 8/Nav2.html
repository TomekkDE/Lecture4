                    world needs different types of ships. There are military ships, cargo ships, Yachts, boats and more....</p>

        <h3>Future</h3>        
        
                <p> do you think there could be something in the future that replaces ships entirely? 
                    Maybe flying boats? Or maybe flying cars that could be used for cargo. We already use 
                Airplanes and cargo planes. But maybe somewhen we develop technologies we can give up boats and ships fully. </p>
