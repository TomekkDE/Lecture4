    Commenting on first quarter results, KR Sridhar, founder, chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy,
    said, “We are very pleased with our operating and financial performance in the first quarter.
    We have done exactly what we set out to do. In many ways, Bloom Energy’s long-term view of the
    macro factors that would drive growth for our business are becoming reality. We have an important
    ability through our product and commercialization strategy to be a meaningful contributor to the 
    energy sector's efforts to support decarbonization. This is creating significant demand and 
    reaffirming our strategy to build a flexible energy platform to decarbonize major segments of the 
    global economy, and every single one of Bloom Energy’s products are effective tools in the global 
    decarbonization effort. This has made Bloom Energy’s solutions not simply an option, but increasingly 
    a necessity. Our focus now is very much on execution.”

    Greg Cameron, executive vice president and CFO of Bloom Energy, added, “We’re off to a great start to the year
    - we delivered record Q1 revenue and our commercial pipeline is strong, in line with our expectations. We remain confident
    in our business and are reaffirming our 2022 financial guidance. We look forward to hosting our Investor Conference on 
    May 25th in Fremont, CA.”
